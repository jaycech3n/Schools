(** Some exercises about equivalences - recall from the course that associativity
    for products of types is not available "on the nose", i.e., just with equality.

    Exercises originally suggested by Benedikt Ahrens and Anders Mörtberg
    (for UniMath school 2017) and elaborated by Ralph Matthes (CNRS, IRIT,
    Univ. Toulouse, France)

Lemma isweqtoempty {X : UU} (f : X -> ∅) : isweq f.

(** Package this up as an equivalence *)
Definition weqtoempty {X : UU} (f : X -> ∅) : X ≃ ∅.
Proof. unfold weq. exact (f,,isweqtoempty f). Qed.

(** Prove that the composition of equivalences is an equivalence.

This is rather difficult to do directly from the definition. Important lemmas
to reason on equality of pairs in a sigma type are given by [base_paths] and
[fiber_paths] that are elimination rules (that use given equality of pairs)
and [total2_paths2_f] that is an introduction rule allowing to establish an
equation between pairs. There, transport arises, but transport along the
identity path is always the identity, and this already computationally, which
means that [cbn] gets rid of it. *)
